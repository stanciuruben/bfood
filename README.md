**BFOOD is a web application for a fictive restaurant, currently under development**

*The goal for this application, is to have a way for the delivery staff to input, or have a gps that inputs their location in the server.
So that the client can see in real time how much time it would take for the delivery to arrive.*

I have decided tu use the MERN stack for this task.

API: Node/Express
DATABASE: MongoDB
AUTHENTICATION: JWT + Bcrypt
CLIENT: React/Javascript + SCSS
